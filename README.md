Code challenge for Critical Mass' internship application

## Work / Project Examples

Movie Playlist Generator  |  https://s7illen.github.io/moviePlaylistGenerator/
A paired programming project using ES6, jQuery and utilizing The MovieDB API. This app prompts the user to search for an actor/actress, if many share the inputted name it prompts the user to select one of up to five headshots. The app then returns a list of up to ten recommended movies, each of which may be re-ordered or deleted by the user. These selections also provide further information about each movie. My partner did more of the CSS styling while I did more of the Javascript and list rendering.

Public Pixel Gallery  |  https://lewisbrignell.github.io/projectFivePublicPixelGallery/
Built by me in React. A gallery of pixel art constructed on 12 x 12 grids from a selection of only ten colours. Users may browse and create their own pieces. Colour mapping data is saved to and pulled from Firebase. As a design, I was going for a look that was something between '1998' and Tumblr.

Not So Social  |  https://not-so-social.github.io/notSoSocial/
This is a weird one, the brief was assigned to us by Juno and was intended to be odd. So bear with me.
This was a mob programming project involving four people, including me. This is basically a plan-cancelling app that pushes regretfully booked Millennials over the edge of cancellation by showing them what TV shows will be broadcast on the date and time of their tentative plans. Plan data is stored in Firebase and new ones can be added. We pull gifs from the GIPHY API to give the plan modules a bit more flavour. The user selects a scheduled obligation and is then shown TV shows pulled from the TV MAZE API - clicking them will navigate to a more detailed page using React Router. The user may select a show which will render a module that compares it to the plan they are avoiding. It's odd. We all split the React coding pretty evenly while I did more of the CSS, which is extremely pink because that's what the brief asked for.


## Inspiration

I don't think one can develop effectively without an excellent understanding of version control on Git, as well as a deeper knowledge of how to control and manipulate items in it. I absolutely don't know how to do half of this stuff yet, but I want to.

Promises in asynchronous Javascript were weird for me at first. Afterwards, I knew when and how to use them but without a deeper understanding of what they can behave to one's benefit. This helped.

I absolutely love this project. I want to make something like it. Can I right now? Nope! But before seeing this, I had no idea it was possible to make something like this with so little Javascript.


## Focus

Given the time and resources, I'd like to focus on deepening my understanding of Javascript and React as well as expanding my skillset. I'd be interested in learning another web framework such as Vue or Angular.
